top bar will have menu items like:
-midi light showing midi device connected, and a light showing midi events
-midi panic button (exclamation point)
-master volume knob

less wide slider so its obvs an on/off switch

put 2 knobs in 2nd row to make room for graph

make drop-down look more like drop-down:
-envelope (ADSR)
-filter
-LFO

ADSR:
4 circular knobs under graph
only do knobs OR graph at first

4 buttons next to envelope for the wave types


when in doubt, model it after xfer


FIX:
-segfault on exit
-midi "inputs" looks for outputs on linux
-envelope graph is invisible
-resize limits aren't actually doing anything (at least on linux)

AUDIO TODO:
-have on/off switch be between midi device and in-window keyboard
-making 2nd osc functional is low priority
-F#5 was very quiet after attack once (can't reproduce)
-A3 is set to 440, not A4
-crackling (by modifying envelope to have less harsh attack)
