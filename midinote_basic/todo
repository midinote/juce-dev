top bar will have menu items like:
-midi light showing midi device connected, and a light showing midi events
-midi panic button (exclamation point)
-master volume knob

less wide slider so its obvs an on/off switch

ADSR:
-4 circular knobs under graph
-make lines between points curve in the standard ADSR way (see mockup v2)
-4 buttons next to envelope for the wave types

add top right profile pics

decide whether menu toolbar should be one button (v2) or spread out (v1)

when in doubt, model it after xfer


FIX:
-segfault on exit
-midi "inputs" looks for outputs on linux
-envelope graph is invisible
-resize limits aren't actually doing anything (at least on linux)

AUDIO TODO:
-have on/off switch be between midi device and in-window keyboard
-making 2nd osc functional is low priority
-F#5 was very quiet after attack once (can't reproduce)
-A3 is set to 440, not A4
-crackling (by modifying envelope to have less harsh attack)
