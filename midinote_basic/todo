CRITICAL BUGS:
-radial buttons won't always update, probably because of race condition (possibly already fixed in last network commit?)
-Filter doesn't work and sounds awful (volume warning); can possibly be fixed by processing the filter in MainContentComponent

MINOR BUGS:
-network code has to get settings from slider.getValue() for some reason
-dBToVolume() garbles that float for some reason (if it's negative)
-segfault on exit
-renaming wavetype buttons' labels to just 2 characters (if window gets too small) can't be done because of a weird error--see comments in RadialButtons::paint()
-resize limits aren't actually doing anything (at least on linux)
-midi "inputs" looks for hardware-level outputs (instead of inputs on JACK and/or ALSA) on linux
-F#5 was very quiet after attack once (can't reproduce)
-JUCE Assertion failure spam whenever an ADSR knob's range becomes 0; nothing else seems to go wrong and those knobs *should* be able to have a range of 0, when their current value is 0 and the ADSR's total length is the length of the graph
-Level slider ignores setValue() in the initialization and defaults to 0.1 no matter what, ever since Jimi set its interval to 0.1 (probably a rounding error)

GUI TOP PRIORITY:
-TBD

LESS PRIORITY:
-filter dB level setting (defaults to whatever JUCE's default is for now, which isn't specified)
-some sort of visual feedback on a successful or unsuccessful network connection
-master volume knob with meter
-tempo (with tap button under it that you can just tap)
-be able to mess with knobs while playing keyboard
-midi light showing midi device connected, and a light showing midi events
-midi panic button (exclamation point)
-midi learn
-Envelope/Filter/LFO drop-down menu actually switches the graph between a visualization of those 3 things
-make lines between points curve in the standard ADSR way (see mockup v2)
-make ADSR logarithmic
-have A, D, S, R in 4 separate graphs?, with a dial for how long each of the 4 is (up to a minute or more) without that changing the actual graphical size of the graph
-replace 2 ADSR graphs with a global one for both synths?
-LFO with depth & rate (frequency), decided by a clickable display box for each BPM and Hz (click one to choose what the knob does)
-nicer-looking knobs by image: https://forum.juce.com/t/creating-custom-guis/8764

AUDIO TOP PRIORITY:
-crackle/pop issue--aliasing
-integrate ADSR with synth in the backend

LESS PRIORITY:
-filter dB level setting (defaults to whatever JUCE's default is for now, which isn't specified)
-have on/off switch be between midi device and in-window keyboard
-make 2nd osc functional
-3 visual oscillators (48 total voices)
-2 routable LFOs that sync over network
-LFO and square/pulse wave relationship not decided yet (Jesse's gonna ask David Kant)

NETWORK TOP PRIORITY:
-TBD

LESS PRIORITY:
-function to check if IP address is valid, for if-check in MainContentComponent::buttonClicked()
-MIDI control syncing
-locks
-Value class to keep track of transmittable stuff more easily (Jimi can make this)
