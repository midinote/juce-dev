This folder contains the source code to the current stand-alone server. I'm pretty sure the build will only work on windows,
but I/Someone should be able to make a different build with the given source (NOT FINAL, USE AT OWN RISK)

The server code (main.cpp) depends on Network.h (and Network.cpp) which can be found in ../midinote_basic/source
